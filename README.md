# Backbone and RequireJS Demo

This project serves as a template and demonstration of using Backbone.js with RequireJS to build a modular and maintainable JavaScript application. It includes a basic setup with a single router and a view, showcasing the capabilities of these libraries in structuring a web application. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of r.js for optimizing and compiling JavaScript files for production.

## Description
